## Generating 'Chance' Dataset

For Y33, I generated n chance observations. Real data assigned 'used' (1) and chance data as 'unused' (0)

```{r, error = TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/mgues/OneDrive - Concordia University - Canada/Desktop/GitHub Reps/Backyard-Birds-MG") 
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(tibble)
library(lmtest)


Y33Trees <- read.csv("1-Input/Y33Trees.csv")
Y33Data<- read.csv("1-Input/Y33_data.csv")

n <- nrow(Y33Data)

l <- levels(as.factor((Y33Trees %>% 
                        unite(unitedY33, c("Tree.species","DBHClass")))$unitedY33))

set.seed(2901)
randompts <- tibble(unitedY33 = sample(l, n, replace = T), .rows = n) %>% 
  separate(unitedY33, c("Tree.species","DBHClass"), sep = "_")

randompts$Presence <- 0

model_data <- bind_rows(Y33Data, randompts)


knitr::kable(model_data, 
             caption = "Real and Chance Observations")
```

## Modeling

With this data set we have: Presence (**binomial dependent variable**) and Tree species and DBH Class as independent variables (**categorical factors**)

It seems like a logistic regression works in this situation (run below)

```{r, error = TRUE}
model <- glm(Presence~Tree.species+DBHClass, family="binomial", data=model_data)
summary(model) 
```

*Issues I'm encountering at this point:*

-   Interpretation of this (very rough) model output? (p-values?)

-   Tree species and DBH class are not independent from each other, not sure how to deal with this (ANCOVA?)
